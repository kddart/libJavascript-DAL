# libJavascript-DAL
DAL client library for Javascript

The file `src/main/dal-client.js` contains the entire library.

A simple usage demo is available in `src/demo`.

The `lib` directory contains the required libraries:

* lodash.js (preferred) or underscore.js
* sha1.js
* jquery-1.9.1.js (other versions may suffice)

These are also enumerated near the top of the main file.

The `lib` directory also holds a copy of `jquery-ui` and `jquery.tinypubsub.min.js`
as these are used by the demo.
